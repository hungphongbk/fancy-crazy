The material is nice and thick so no worries of \"see-through\" (at least not that I could tell when stretching and looking in the mirror). The legs are long. I'm 5'6\" and there's a little bit of bunching (either in the knees or ankles, depending on where I stretch the material), but for the most part I don't mind this. You can wear these to work out or just for every day casual. There's a very spacious hidden pocket in the waist band. I could fit my iPhone into it width-wise and it went as deep as halfway up the phone. While I wouldn't keep a phone in there all the time, it's good in a pinch since it can fit it. But it'll definitely hold just about any keys and any money that you have. You can't tell from the photo, but the waist band is lined with a hot pink material. If you're planning on wearing crop tops, be aware of that. I don't personally wear crop tops so this doesn't matter to me, but if you don't, know you might see a little bit of pink peeping out of the top of the waistband. Also, for a high waist, I felt this waist band came a little bit lower than my other waistbands. This does NOT cover my belly button like many of my other high-waisted leggings do, but this is not an issue for me. I know a lot of teens/children wear high-waisted leggings so they can wear crop tops to school and not have their belly buttons or skin showing, so pointing this out just in case that's why you're purchasing.","image_url":"/s/files/1/1946/1613/products/22-5_mk_QUAN.jpg?v=1527045012"},{"group":"group1","type":"image-with-data","rating":"5","review_customer_name":"Gina","review_date":"04/30/2018","review_title":"Great Price- perfect for a hike","review_content":"Great Price- perfect for a hike","image_url":"/s/files/1/1946/1613/products/XLN-19761RIGHT.png?v=1527043939"},{"group":"group1","type":"image-with-data","rating":"4","review_customer_name":"Judith D.","review_date":"04/26/2018","review_title":"Love these leggings, they are super comfy!!","review_content":"Received these yesterday and can't get over how comfy they are!
