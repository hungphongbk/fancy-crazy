I think that it is even prettier in real life. My daughter has notoriously had bad dreams and I originally got the idea of getting her a dream catcher to \"catch all of her bad dreams\" a few years ago. I found a small and very plain dream catcher and she absolutely loved it and found some comfort in it. She has had it for a few years and has a hard time not taking it down and touching, and needless to say it broke about a month ago. When she saw the new dream catcher she was so excited! It looks so pretty on her wall and the colors are all so vibrant. She also loves the feathers on it (so do our cats, so make sure you hang it high enough). This dream catcher is made very well and I know it will last for a long time. My daughter couldn't be happier with her new dream catcher. I purchased this dream catcher at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and that is exactly what I am giving. I will always give my wholehearted honest opinion on a product whether it is good or bad, because I depend on reading reviews when deciding to make my own purchases and expect people to be honest.","image_url":"/s/files/1/1946/1613/products/product-image-392336281.jpg?v=1525953727"},{"group":"group 1","type":"image-with-data","rating":"5 sao","review_customer_name":"gmhill","review_date":"May 23, 2018","review_title":"Cool looking dream catcher. good piece of native american culture","review_content":"This is a good hand made traditional dream catcher. It is woven very well and the quality feels sturdy.  I will gift this to my sister in law, since those are her favorite colors. This is a great piece of indigenous native American culture. Although this is called a dream catcher I do not believe in that mumbo jumbo. I treat this as a cultural and spiritual piece of art or accessory. It's like having a Buddha statue or a quartz crystal laying around your home. In other words, this won't do a damn thing for you but it makes a nice talking peace or accessory to your living space. I am a fan of indigenous cultures and the art that is associated with them. My cousin calls these dust catchers because the one she owns is a magnet for the dust in your house. I think it is due to the webbing like design that as air flows through it it picks up dust particles. This is not a problem because I would make sure to clean and dust this at least once a month. All in all, I think this is a well-made dream catcher for those who want to accessorize their home with a piece of indigenous cultural art or anyone who appreciates Native American culture. If you are in the market for a product such as this, then do not hesitate to buy from this seller. I have giving you my honest experience with this product, for which I received a discount from the seller.","image_url":"/s/files/1/1946/1613/products/5.png?v=1526264730"},{"group":"group 1","type":"image-with-data","rating":"5 sao","review_customer_name":"Rebecca Beyer","review_date":"March 30, 2018","review_title":"The Pop","review_content":"I'm not much for the mystic aspects of the Dream Catcher but can appreciate the culture that created it and really like the idea behind it.... but what I picked it up for is pure aesthetics.
