VyIelKjIX,Active,4,tuan.nguyen162991@gmail.com,,Svetlana,"These boots look very cute, and, if you posses the courage and perseverance needed to put them on your toddler, you will get a lot of compliments and the said toddler will be happy wearing them. At least that's the case with my 17 month old girl. They are light and waterproof, although they are rather stiff and do not bend, so my little one looks a bit like she is walking in ski boots. But she does not seem to mind that, to my surprise.
However, it is a struggle to put them on, and to take them off - they are quite a bit too narrow right above the instep - it helps keeping the boots from falling off the little feet, but, like I said, the boots are very very tricky to put on. And some toddlers (or all of them) lack the patience. Sometimes my girl would get frustrated with the process and refuse wearing them at all. I wish they were easier to put on, then I would give them 5 stars for sure.
Sizing: I think they run a bit small. I got 6, and now I regret it, I think I should have gone a size bigger. If you are in doubt, get a larger size, it would make it easier to put the boots on, but because they are made to fit snugly around the ankle, they will not fall off even if they are larger.
Color: I got bight yellow, and it looks just like the picture. The white stays relatively clean, easy to rinse and wipe off - they have not stained yet (My girl has worn them quite a bit, we live in OR and it rains here, you know :)
So, to sum up - very cute bright and light, completely water tight. Very hard to put on. Size up for easier life :)",2017-08-03T02:56:51.134Z,11360395852,boot1,,,

I wear a lot of unisex shirts and always purchase smalls (not that they make many XS).
I was struggling to find some fitted plain shirts for layering this time of year and was about fed up with my search attempts.
I am NOT a fan of women's V-neck shirts and was explaining that to someone when I mentioned this one shirt I had that was a V-neck and wasn't too low.
I received this particular shirt as a give-away from a trade show.
I looked at the tag and it mentioned that it was by Next Level Apparel so I went searching.
I quickly found their website and this particular style since it was the only unisex/men's vneck available but clearly this company only sold these shirts for mass printing for these types of things so back I went to google with the style number this time.
They came up immediately on amazon and I was very happy to see they even had XS options!
I purchased 1 of the 4 shirts I bought in a S and the other 3 in XS and XS is perfect for the size.
The S is fine too, it's just a slightly looser fit.
I have had my original shirt for months and it fits the same as the first day I got it and it's still just as soft
Seriously. Soft. So soft!
They are NOT super thin, they they some thickness to them, but not in a THICK tshirt kind of way.
It's hard to explain, just know that if you're a woman looking, you shouldn't be worried about your bra showing through.
These are 100% my go-to plain tshirt from now on and I can't wait to try some other styles eventually.

I purchased 4 of these shirts so I'm just copy/pasting the same review for all of them.",2017-08-03T01:42:23.511Z,11176368012,my-church-t-shirt-1,,,

The cut in the v-neck is perfect for a dress shirt with top button un-buttoned. It doesn't show (my previous undershirt showed a bit).

I'm 6'2"" 210 lbs and prefer to wear shirts with tighter sleeves to show a more athletic look. For whatever reason, finding one that has a good long length with sleeves that do not flare out has been more difficult than it should be no matter what price I pay. These shirts fit nicely even after they come out of the dryer. I bought a large and to be honest the sleeves may have been even tighter than I would've preferred but it didn't bother me considering the opposite(baggier sleeves) seems to be the norm and also a deal breaker. I ended up buying an extra large as well since these are so cheap and it ended up probably being a better fit so I recommend you buy your normal tee shirt size here. The sleeves were still tight, the length was a bit longer and it was only slightly wider. The material is nice and soft and they barely shrink the first time you dry them. I ended up buying 5 more of these and will likely continue to come back for more as necessary. Highly recommended!",2017-08-03T01:37:40.726Z,11189398028,nation-t-shirt-2,,,

These t-shirts have become a staple for me. They're great for any casual setting, very lightweight, and they hold up remarkably well after several washes. No color fading, no rips or tears in any of mine yet (I must own around ~20 by now). I only buy a few duplicates of my favorites because I'm liable to get oil stains on any and all pieces of clothing I own for some reason.

Anyway, highly recommend these - they fit great around the arms, the V isn't too deep, and they aren't overly long (I'm 5'7"" and they taper off perfectly around pockets on most of my pants). They also fit a bit snugly toward the bottom - doesn't look like a loose tshirt hanging all over the place.

Size wise they're what you'd expect. I'm typically a medium (5'7"", small frame, 155lb) and these fit great in medium. Large would definitely be too loose on me whereas medium is form-fitting.",2017-08-03T01:35:10.246Z,11189440268,nation-t-shirt-3,,,

I really like everything that Kenneth Cole makes and I appreciate the fact that it's way more affordable than many other brands of mens clothes and accessories. The best part is that they aren't cheap! They don't fall apart easily, they're very comfortable, and most importantly they look GREAT! I've received so many compliments about them and lots of guys have asked where I bought them.

It's really fun to buy something online that you're completely thrilled about because it's even better than you thought that they'd be!

The quality seems very good. They are a little stiff but I think that after a little wear they will loosen up. It's a very good value for the price and am very happy with this purchase. Update 2 months later. The shoes did get much more comfortable after a few uses. I was the 1st one to review. I was surprised to hear that others had issues with wear. So far so good. I will revisit after a bit more use.",2017-07-25T08:32:05.955Z,11408393420,black-and-colour-pattern,,,

glue it back together but
